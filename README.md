**Movie Recommendation System**:
A machine learning-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on genres, keywords, cast, and director. It utilizes TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity for content-based filtering.
Project Overview:
Analyzing movie metadata (genres, keywords, cast, director)
Computing similarity scores using TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity
Providing personalized recommendations
Exposing an API for easy integration
 Key Features:
ðŸ”¹ Content-based filtering using machine learning
ðŸ”¹ Real-time recommendations based on user input
ðŸ”¹ Customizable dataset â€“ works with any movies.csv
ðŸ”¹ Scalable and lightweight solution
 Methodology:
**1** Data Preprocessing
Loaded movies.csv dataset
Handled missing values in genres, keywords, tagline, cast, director
Created combined text features for vectorization
**2** Feature Extraction
Applied TF-IDF Vectorization to extract text-based features
Converted text into numerical feature vectors
**3** Similarity Calculation
Used Cosine Similarity to compute distances between movies
Retrieved top-N similar movies for a given title
**4** API Deployment
Built a Flask API for real-time recommendations
Allowed dynamic movie search via API

Technologies Used:
ðŸŸ¢ Python - Core programming language
ðŸŸ¢ Pandas - Data manipulation
ðŸŸ¢ NumPy - Numerical operations
ðŸŸ¢ Scikit-Learn - Machine learning & similarity calculation
ðŸŸ¢ Flask - API development
ðŸŸ¢ Jupyter Notebook - Model testing
